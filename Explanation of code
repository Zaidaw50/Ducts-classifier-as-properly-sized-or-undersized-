1. Import Libraries

pandas is used to load and manipulate data.

train_test_split helps to divide the dataset into training and testing sets.

DecisionTreeClassifier is the machine learning algorithm being used.

accuracy_score and classification_report are for evaluating how well the model performs.
---
2. Load the Data
The Excel file containing the HVAC data is read into a DataFrame named df.
---
3. Create a Target Variable (Size)
A new column called Size is created using a rule:

If velocity is more than 20 m/s or pressure loss is more than 5 Pa/m, it's labeled as "Undersized".

Otherwise, it's labeled as "Properly sized".

---
4. Select Features and Target

The features used for prediction are: Airflow Rate, Velocity, and Pressure Loss.

The target variable is the newly created Size column.
---
5. Split the Data
The dataset is split into 80% training and 20% testing data to evaluate how well the model performs on unseen data.

---
6. Train the Decision Tree Model
The decision tree classifier is trained on the training data using the selected features.
---
7. Make Predictions
The trained model is used to predict the target values on the test set.
---
8. Evaluate the Model

Accuracy tells you how many predictions were correct overall.

Classification Report gives you a detailed breakdown of precision, recall, and F1-score for each class (Undersized or Properly sized).
---
9. Display the Results
The accuracy and classification report are printed so you can see how well the model did.
