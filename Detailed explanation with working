Classifying HVAC Ducts: A Machine Learning Approach with Google Colab and GitHub

In this blog post, we will walk through the process of classifying HVAC ducts as either properly sized or undersized using machine learning. We use airflow rate, velocity, and pressure loss as features to make the classification. In our approach, a simple rule of thumb determines the target label, and we build a decision tree classifier to predict the duct size.

We’ll explain the complete process using Python on Google Colab and conclude with guidance on how to post your project to GitHub.

1. Problem Statement

In HVAC systems, duct sizing is crucial for efficiency and system performance. Ducts that are undersized can lead to increased velocity and higher pressure loss, which in turn results in noise, energy loss, and overall inefficiency.

Our Objective:

Input: Airflow rate (CFM), Velocity (m/s), Pressure Loss (Pa/m).

Output: Classification of the duct as either properly sized or undersized.


Rule of Thumb for Labeling

For this project, we use a simplified rule:

Undersized: if the duct has a velocity greater than 20 m/s or a pressure loss exceeding 5 Pa/m.

Properly sized: if neither of the above conditions are met.


> Note: In real applications, these thresholds may be adjusted based on guidelines from industry organizations such as ASHRAE .

2. Data Preparation

Assume you have an Excel file (HVAC_Duct_System_Data.xlsx) with the following columns:

Airflow Rate (CFM)

Velocity (m/s)

Pressure Loss (Pa/m)


The first step is to load the data and generate a target variable based on our rule.

import pandas as pd

# Load the data from the Excel file
file_path = "/mnt/data/HVAC_Duct_System_Data.xlsx"
df = pd.read_excel(file_path, sheet_name='Sheet1')

# Create the binary target variable 'Size' using our rule of thumb
df['Size'] = df.apply(lambda row: 'Undersized' if (row['Velocity (m/s)'] > 20 or row['Pressure Loss (Pa/m)'] > 5)
                                  else 'Properly sized', axis=1)

# Display the first few rows
print(df.head())

3. Building the Machine Learning Model

With the data prepared, we split the dataset into training and testing sets, and then train a Decision Tree Classifier.

Training and Evaluating the Model

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score

# Define features and target
features = ['Airflow Rate (CFM)', 'Velocity (m/s)', 'Pressure Loss (Pa/m)']
X = df[features]
y = df['Size']

# Split data into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the Decision Tree Classifier
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model performance
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)

print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
print("Classification Report:")
print(report)

Expected Output

Running this code on Google Colab might produce an output similar to:

Accuracy: 0.95
Classification Report:
                 precision    recall  f1-score   support

  Properly sized       0.93      0.96      0.95        25
     Undersized       0.96      0.93      0.94        23

       accuracy                           0.95        48
      macro avg       0.95      0.95      0.95        48
   weighted avg       0.95      0.95      0.95        48

Note: The above numbers are indicative and will vary based on your dataset.

4. Using Google Colab

Google Colab is an excellent platform for interactive Python coding, especially for data science projects. Here's how you can use it for this project:

1. Upload your Data:
Open a new notebook in Google Colab and upload the HVAC_Duct_System_Data.xlsx file via the sidebar.


2. Run the Code:
Copy and paste the code snippets above into cells and run them sequentially. Google Colab will execute the code in a cloud environment, making it easy to share and collaborate.


3. Save and Share:
Once your notebook is complete, you can save it directly to your Google Drive or download it as an .ipynb file.



For more detailed instructions on using Google Colab, refer to Google Colab’s documentation .

5. Posting on GitHub

After verifying that your project runs smoothly in Google Colab, you can post your project on GitHub by following these steps:

1. Create a New Repository:
Go to GitHub and create a new repository. Name it something descriptive like HVAC-Duct-Classification.


2. Upload Your Files:
Upload your notebook (.ipynb), the Excel dataset, and any additional resources (such as a README.md file).


3. Document Your Project:
Your README.md should include:

Project Overview: What the project does.

Installation Instructions: How to run the code (including a note about using Google Colab).

Usage Examples: How to interpret the output.

License: If applicable.



4. Commit and Push:
Use Git or the GitHub web interface to commit your changes and push them to your repository.
