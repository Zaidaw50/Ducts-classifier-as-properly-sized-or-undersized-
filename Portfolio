HVAC Duct Classification Using Machine Learning

Overview

Proper duct sizing is critical in HVAC systems to ensure energy efficiency and prevent system strain. In this project, we use machine learning to classify HVAC ducts as either properly sized or undersized based on key airflow parameters:

Airflow Rate (CFM)

Velocity (m/s)

Pressure Loss (Pa/m)


This end-to-end project demonstrates how machine learning can support mechanical engineering decisions through data-driven analysis.


---

Objectives

Automate the classification of HVAC ducts using threshold-based engineering rules.

Apply a Decision Tree Classifier to learn from labeled engineering data.

Provide actionable insights for HVAC designers and technicians.



---

Dataset

The dataset includes duct-level measurements such as:

Airflow Rate (CFM)

Velocity (m/s)

Pressure Loss (Pa/m)


A duct is labeled as:

Properly sized if velocity ≤ 20 m/s and pressure loss ≤ 5 Pa/m

Undersized otherwise
